/*
 * Struct sequences are relatively simple subclasses of tuple, so we provide the
 * simplified API to create them here. This maps closely to the CPython limited
 * API for creating struct sequences. However, in universal mode we use the
 * collections.namedtuple type to implement this, which behaves a bit
 * differently w.r.t. hidden elements. Thus, the n_in_sequence field available
 * in CPython's PyStructSequence_Desc is not available. Also, we use a builder
 * API like for tuples and lists so that the struct sequence is guaranteed not
 * to be written after it is created.
